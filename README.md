# Smart Gaz Pratical Class

This project is a pratical class to teach students how to use MQTT and CoAP protocols within an IoT project.

This is a git project with two main branches:
- exercice : where you can find all questions to answer during this pratical class
- solution : where you can find all answers to the previous questions (this branch will be available at the end)

This project is composed of two parts:
- MQTT
- COAP

First start with the MQTT part by reading the file mqtt/README.mq. Finally, finish with the COAP part by reading the file coap/README.mq
